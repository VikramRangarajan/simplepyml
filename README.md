# simplepyml

A simple Neural Network library to experiment with backpropagation calculus,
convolutions, creating python modules, and using Git + GitHub

Goals:
- Implement multi layer perceptron neural networks with many activation functions,
loss functions, optimization algorithms
- Research and implement other ML models such as decision trees, etc.
